`Data` 
- This chunk reads our data as a csv file from the environment

`player_eff. R` 
- This chunck of code reads in the data
-This project uses NBA box score data to calculate:
 1.  **Team-level shooting efficiency** (field goals made vs. field goals attempted),
 2. **Player-level shooting efficiency**, and
 3. A **Player Impact Score** that includes offensive and defensive contributions.

For this analysis, I used field_goal as the measure of successful shots and field_goal_atmpts as total attempts. These variables are both reported per 36 minutes and reflect overall scoring efficiency. I then created a success ratio (field_goal / field_goal_atmpts) and ranked teams based on that efficiency score.
